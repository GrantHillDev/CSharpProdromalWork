The more time I spend programming in C#, the more I being to associate the term implicit with the term inferred....

Obviously, writing it in this way enables the method to pass all of the tests, and I'm looking at what's happening when i == j, or not setting i != j (leaving it out), and the index variable always returns a value of negative 1.... so I know that it's acting as a filter for what the value of index i is, but I just don't get the logic of i != j in this instance, resulting in that.

            for (var i = n - 1; i < elements.Count; i += n)//oh, now I see how this works -- n seems to represent the 'element' of the elements array at its index i. So if i is equal to four, then n needs to represent its fourth element (the fourth element stemming from wherever i is parsing at any given index of the elements list). This was initially confusing because indexes and elements represent the same thing in a list or an array, but I suppose it's better to not remain redundant with either phrase in this context because doing such would only make the instructions for completing this method even more confounding. n has to be minus-ed by 1 because of how arrays and lists start at an index of 0, but now for every parsed index i of the elements list, we increment by n; meaning that no matter what index i is at, its value will be translated into n's value simultaneously, matching i's value and therefore enabling the script to increment by n. Honestly, the instructions for this method were already pretty vague to me -- I wouldn't have known what every nth element was even getting at.... might want to find a way to ensure that solving for methods such as these are made more explicitly clear to newcomers such as myself.
            {
                nthElement.Add(elements[i]);//for every index i of elements, while n is equal to i - 1 (just means that n is equal to i without being compromised by the initial index of 0 offsetting the true value pertaining to where i is parsing at any given executuon of the script) add i to elements.... and this works well by itself because i is being incremented by n each time the script executers, thereby including whatever nth element i needs to satisfy the unit tests.
            }

        }
