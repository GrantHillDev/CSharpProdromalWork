Updated; it does work, and it's appropriate for this block of code, but it turns out that VS Community isn't terribly reliable at updating itself when lines of ode are being changed ro rewritten....making unit testing pointless, but I shouldn't havhe to stop what I'm doing and restart VS Community just for it to be able to read my code properly, especially as it pertains to unit testing. Very frustrating.//apparently, operators can be used for string types....
                }//just found out that .Trim only removes blank spaces that are before and after the whole string, so if it contains multiple words, like in this instance, it will not work on individual words that may contain excessive blank spaces.
            }//The extra space in the code above ensures that all characters coming together to form words in the string's entirety only have one space between them, and will be trimmed first in case they any other excessive spaces (this could be useful in the event someone typed in 2 or 3 or more extra blanks spaces than they needed to.... and this enhances the functionality of the .Trim method to properly space out each word, rather than limiting it only working on the string as a whole).

Updated; it doesn't work unless you set itself equal to itself, but trimmed one more time....and then the period would be ready to be added. Gosh it all comes back to one very fundamental principle in object oriented programming; we need variables and objects to store our data for us.... what was happening before was sentence.Trim(); by itself wasn't storing the result of what it was doing.... and therefore, the program never got a chance to register that for itself, and thus the same tests kept getting failed over and over again....I have my moments. The scary thing is.... break points would not have helped me diagnose this problem any quicker, likely, because I would have kept getting faced with the same execution result each time, but without knowing why, only knowing that it was being caused by the same problem, from the same line of code, but again, the fundamental reason for why it wasn't working really just comes back to making sure you've got a means to return the right data -- that's why we made the sentence variable.//sentence.TrimEnd();
            sentence += ".";//The above line of code would actually work as it pertains to the unit tests for this method.... because the period isn't being added in until after the .Trim has been executed on the rest of the string.... but for some unknown reason, it's not.
