Logical thought suggests that if there were no direct way of passing value types into a similar method that was using a sequence of numbers as a series of digits just like a string type would, then such numbers could actually be converted into strings anyway, but doing this would most likely obsolete, because the purpose of parsing through numbers is often different than parsing through reference types, even if they're individual characters/indexes (arrays versus strings).

        }//Remember to - 1 from the  total count of whatever the array's length ends up being because technically, the array's length doesn't account for a value of zero as part of its total index count -- I'll write out an example below.
         //var nums = new int [10];
         //nums now looks like this for its size;   | 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10| -- these represent the chronological values of numbers stored within the indexes, but at the same time, they collectively represent the array's size.
         //if we were to try and print nums' final  |     1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,|  10   index to the console without deducting a value of one, here's what physically happens -- what's thought to be nums' tenth index is actually what would be its eleventh index, because it gets pushed up by a value of 1 due to the first index of the array being assigned to zero. But an 11th index doesn't exist here because we only made it 10 indexes large in size, and this is why an error gets thrown when such an approach to printing say a final index of an array is done without subtracting a value of one from it.
         //nums now looks like this for its indexes;|[0],[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9]| -- these represent the indexes which those values are stored in.
         //so, if we deduct a value of 1 from nums total size (length), its final index should actually match up with the value representing the total size of the array minus one, because this is the only way we can communicate to the computer through C# that we want to access the array's final index (unless each index was specified and typed out, then we could code for it in the scope, but when we don't have a defined array size [say in this case where it's being passed as an argument into a method] then this sort of syntactic scripting method works well..
         //                                               1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9.  -- nums' highest index is 9 even though its size is 10.
         //the zero index will always remain as nums' first index. There's no need to add or deduct from it.
         //The last element is at index (Length - 1) because Length gives the total number of elements, not the highest index. The highest index will always be one less than what the total number of elements is because the first index starts at 0, not at 1 like the total number of elements would. I've encountered this before in previous exercises.... if the total number of elements or length of the array aren't deducted by at least one, then the index the script would be attempting to print to the console doesn't technically exist, because it goes beyond what highest index is for the array's size.
         //int[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };
         //Console.WriteLine(numbers.Length);      // Output: 5
         //Console.WriteLine(numbers[0]);         // First element: 10
         //Console.WriteLine(numbers[4]);         // Last element: 50
         //Console.WriteLine(numbers[numbers.Length - 1]); // Also last element: 50
         //adding onto the example I wrote out above, if we wanted to access nums' sixth index, it'd be the same principle that we used to access its last index -- we'd be writing something along the lines of nums.Length - 5, because nums' sixth index can only be accessed in this instance by way of telling the computer to subtract a value of 5 from its total size, which is consequently going to yield the number 5, that's also the sixth index, because all indexes start at zero (apologies for redundancy, but it took me writing all of this out to concretely understand the relationship between indexes and collection sizes and how they constitute a uniform means of index accessibility within a collection type variable.
