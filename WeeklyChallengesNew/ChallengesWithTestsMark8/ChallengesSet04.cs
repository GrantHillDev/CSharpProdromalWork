Oh, and looking this up on google didn't help either. Provide proper context; write a method that's not as ambiguous as this one -- something along the lines of: DoesTriangleHaveTwoSidesGreaterThanItsThirdSide.... and then at least someone who's learning this might have reasonable shot at figuring out what the method is asking for.
